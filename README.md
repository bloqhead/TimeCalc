# TimeCalc Electron app

A simple time-to-decimal desktop calculator. This was originally [a Codepen post](https://codepen.io/bloqhead/pen/bqXjvQ). I built the Electron version using the [Electron Fiddle app](https://github.com/electron/fiddle). I'm not usually a huge fan of having my computer littered with giant Electron apps, but this was a fun experiment and will help some colleagues.

Releases section coming soon.
